# Google Mock

## About
This is a mock of google homepage and search result page.

## Features
- Suggestion on the input
- Search keyword adds to result page


## Installation
To preview the project it is advices to serve it else ajax fetch will be unable to get the mock data cause of CORS restriction;

__NOTE__: **The project is not designed to be responsive thus for exact look alike, I suggest to test on a 13 inches monitor**

NPM librarys to use are to start the project:
- [Serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve): `npm i -g serve`
- [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server): `npm i -g live-server`


Then start the project from your cli with the command once either of those libraries are installed:
- Serve: `serve`
- Live Server: `live-server`
